* usage total (sum of usage own and import) during year (daily)
* mean production vs. mean usage total (monthly) 
* mean for each factor (monthly) 
* maintenance usage level
* occupied and free days
* usage total with free days on zero level
* yearly figures (sum of values)
* level of indicator of usage own
* if production covers energy usage
